# 🧠 DetRan: Detection Engineering in Action

## About

**DetRan** (short for *Detection + Ransomware*) is a personal and evolving repository focused on building and refining **Sigma detection rules** inspired by real-world threats, red team labs, malware campaigns, and adversary tradecraft I encounter in my day-to-day experiences as a security engineer.

The goal is to:

- 🧪 Simulate and study recent malware or threat actor behavior in lab environments.
- 📜 Write Sigma rules to detect the **exact behavior**, not just indicators.
- 🧭 Map all detection efforts to the **MITRE ATT&CK framework**.
- 🛡️ Improve my own detection engineering skills while giving back to the community.
- ⚒️ Experiment with **SIEM-friendly** detection logic (e.g., Splunk, Elastic).

This repo serves as both a **knowledge base** and a **detection development lab** — constantly being updated as I encounter new threat scenarios, participate in red team/blue team exercises, or analyze public incident reports and threat intel.

## Learning Approach

- Research public reports from Microsoft, SentinelOne, Cybereason, BleepingComputer, and others
- Simulate adversary behavior using Atomic Red Team, custom scripts, or malware sandboxes
- Continuously iterate on detection quality and false positive tuning
- Track TTP evolution in MITRE ATT&CK and CTI feeds
